## Part I - Visualizing

#### Goal

The goal of the first hackathon part is to produce three quality visulializations illustrating...

1. The frequency distribution of sustainable development goals detected in Unibas publications and projects. 
2. The relationship between sustainable development goals. 
3. The distribution of sustainable development goals detected in Unibas publications and projects as a function of Unibas organizational units. 

#### Rules

1. Each group creates and works in a single R script that is given a unique name by the group, e.g., a group pseudonym, to not infer with the other group's script files. The script file is stored in `1_code`. See code template including the placehold `GROUPPSEUDONYM`.
2. Each group creates three .pdf figures files in the `2_figures` folder. Figure files also must receive a suffix identifying the group. See example figure. 
3. Pull before you Push.
