## Data

#### Preliminaries

The sustainability office of the University of Basel provided us with a multiple databases containing information of the University's historical electronic research output (publications and funded projects). 

These data have been preprocessed in the following way:

<i>Publications</i>

1. Included journal articles (N = 43,229), book items (chapters, 13,443), journal items (5,028), proceeding items (2,144), and books (1,897).
2. Selected publications with English titles (~85%) and DOI present (~80%) that were published between 2010 and 2020 (~60%). About half of all publications remained.    
3. Identified abstracts for all publications using <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rscopus/index.html">rscopus</a>. About ~85% of abstracts could be retrieved.    

<i>Publications & Projects</i>

1. Identified faculty-level organizational unit within the University of Basel (including associated and cross-disciplinary institutes) for each item. 
2. Using translations of the SDG queries of the <a href="https://github.com/Aurora-Network-Global/sdg-queries">Aurora network</a> and the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corpustools/corpustools.pdf">corpustools</a> R package, detected wether titles or abstracts were SDG-relevant.
